Additional Authorship:

Francisco Blas Izquierdo Riera (klondike) had contributed siv and cmac
modes of operation which have since been removed due to a lack of users and
constant complaints of compile time (due to the CPoly module).  I regard the
compile time issue as a bug in GHC but the only realistic action I can take is
to avoid the bug. Prospective users can find this code in the repo and are
encouraged to fork it / upload to hackage as a stand-alone package.
